            <p class="asdfghjkl">New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North
         Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area, covering 268,021 square kilometres
          (103,500 sq mi). New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the islands of
           New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions.
            New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.
        The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then
         developed a
         distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United
          Kingdom and Māori
          chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which in its English version declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the 
          British Empire.
           Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land. 
           New Zealand became
            a dominion in 1907; it gained full statutory independence in 1947, retaining the monarch as head of state. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of
             5.1 million is of
             European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived
              from Māori
              and early British 
        settlers, with recent broadening of culture arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the
         local
         dialect of 
        English being dominant.
        A developed country, New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, education, protection of civil liberties,
         government transparency, and economic freedom. The country was the first to introduce a minimum wage, and the first to give women the right to vote.
          New Zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy.
           The service sector dominates the national economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture; international tourism is also a significant 
           source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, 
           led
            by the 
           prime minister, currently Chris Hipkins. King Charles III is the country's monarch and is represented by the governor-general. In addition, New Zealand is organised 
           into 11
            regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook
             Islands and Niue
             (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica
